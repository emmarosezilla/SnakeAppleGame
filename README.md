This game is essentially an underwater version of the classic Snake game. I used an array of blue dots to construct the eel, and the eel's movement is controlled by user keyboard input. 
I also constructed a shark character that collides and bounces off the game parametres. The shark character - when it collides with the eel array's hitbox - initiates the "game over." 
Additionally, to gain points and increase the eel's size, I randomly generated an array of eggs that would appear one by one each time the eel eats it.
